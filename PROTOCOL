= messages sent by client =

mode: pencil
data: [array with every four consecutive elements corresponding to a pencil action]
every action is encoded by four elements: int type, int x, int y, int tick. a type of 1 corresponds to pencilDown, type = 0 is pencilMove and type = -1 is pencilUp.
all actions cost ink. the cost of pencilMove or pencilUp is the length over which the pencil is moved, the cost of pencilDown is pencilDownInk.
things to note:
- always send actions in chronological order. however, strictly increasing ticks are not necessary.
- a pencilMove message should always move the pencil at least inkMinDistance
- never move the pencil outside the map
- it is not specified what happens when you send actions which can not be executed (e.g. there is not enough ink, the message has not the right format, ...).

mode: input
steer: -1 for right steer key down, 0 for current steer key up, 1 for left steer key down
tick: tick in which this input will be simulated
- inputs should be sent with strictly increasing tick value.
- server will modify tick value when simulation is ahead of tick

= messages sent by server =

mode: pencil
data: [array of objects]
every object has members x1, x2, y1, y2, tickSolid, playerId. this corresponds to a segment of player playerId which is going to spawn at tick tickSolid.

= server byte messages =
to save on bandwidth, the server sends some common messages in binary instead of in JSON. the data is encoded in characters. these so-called byte messages are in bigEndian format (but platform independant, both server as client!).

x is for reserved bit
d is for tick-delta (difference with last input tick)
i is for player index
j is for input index
t is for turn change. always 2 options for turn. 0 encodes the most left option, 1 the most right
m is for mode

input message
NOTE: does not have mode member!
layout: xdddtiii xddddddd

input modification message
layout: xjjjjmmm xjjjjjjj xdddjjjj xddddddd

tick update message
layout: xdiiimmm xddddddd xddddddd

= more info =

- pencil -
you start with maxInk ink. RE: don't you start with startInk ink, which may or may not be maxInk, depending on what server dictates?
every tick you get inkPerSec * tickLength ink, taking maxInk into account.
you have three actions: pencilDown, pencilMove and pencilUp. all are sent through the pencil message. you will receive drawings from other players also through a pencil message.


======= BYTE MESSAGES ======
komt nog.. TURNCHANGE werkt zo: er zijn altijd 2 opties: 0 is de meest linker optie, 1 is de meest rechter optie -- moet in PROTOCOL
