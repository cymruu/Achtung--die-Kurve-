= messages sent by client =

mode: input
steer: -1 for right steer key down, 0 for current steer key up, 1 for left steer key down
tick: tick in which this input will be simulated
- inputs should be sent with strictly increasing tick value.
- server will modify tick value when simulation is ahead of tick

mode: pencil
data: array of which every three consecutive elements correspond to a pencil position: int x, int y, int tick. one exception: the first element of the array can be -1, which denotes that the first position is a pencil down position

= server byte messages =
to save on bandwidth, the server sends some common messages in binary instead of in JSON. the data is encoded in characters. these so-called byte messages are in bigEndian format (but platform independant, both server as client!).

x is for reserved bit
d is for tick-delta (difference with last input tick)
i is for player index
j is for input index
t is for turn change. always 2 options for turn. 0 encodes the most left option, 1 the most right
m is for mode
. is for free bit

input message
NOTE: does not have mode member!
layout: xdddtiii xddddddd

input modification message
layout: xjjjjmmm xjjjjjjj xdddjjjj xddddddd

tick update message
layout: xdiiimmm xddddddd xddddddd

position on the map is encoded in 3 bytes
layout: xxxxxxx yyyxxxx yyyyyyy (x for x position, y for y position, and only first 7 bits of each byte are shown)
